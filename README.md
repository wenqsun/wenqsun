### Here we go!✨✨✨

Nice to meet you! My name is [Wenqiang Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XEUeiTEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (Chinese name: 孙文强), and you can call me Jeffrey. Now I am a second-year PhD student at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

## Research Area
- 🤔 I am focused on generative models, including Diffusion Models and AutoRegressive Models. Recently, my research interests are mainly about the controllable image generation and text-to-3D generation in diffusion models.
- 🔭 Previously, I was interested in the security and privacy in deep learning, especially in federated learning, including adversarial attack, gradient inversion and membership inference attack. Besides that, I am also interested in the tradeoff between the performance and privacy in federated learning.
- 🧐 I also conducted some research about meta reinforcement learning and offline reinforcement learning when I was an undergraduate in Nanjing University. If you are interested in this area, welcome to come and talk with me, I am so glad to learn from you!
