## Research Area
- 🔭 I’m currently focused on the security and privacy in deep learning, especially in federated learning, including gradient inversion, membership inference attack, backdoor attack and adversarial attack, etc. Besides that, I am also interested in the tradeoff between the performance and privacy in federated learning.
- 🧐 I also do some research about meta reinforcement learning when I was an undergraduate in Nanjing University. If you are interested in this area, come and talk with me, I am so glad to learn from you!
- 🤔 I am surprised with the powerful LLM (ChatGPT, GPT-4, etc.). Recently, I start to spare some time to learn LLM and try to do something interesting using GPT APIs. Welcome to contact me and brainstorm together!
